# Prankster Twins

The hint provided pointed us to a the [Harry Potter Fandom Wiki](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki) and as we knew the clip is referncing Fred and George Weasley we starting looking for relevant accounts.

We found the account by the name [Fredandgeorge0478](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/User:Fredandgeorge0478) where we find hints related to finding ancient pages.

On searching in Web Archive we found [this link](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/User:Fredandgeorge0478?direction=prev&oldid=1752883). We  find the history of edits on this page and find the answer to the divination as **'RAVENCLAW'**.

For the password we check the wiki page for possible passwords of the Headmaster's Office and try them. It is then found to be **"LemonDrops"**.
