# Cyber Pursuit Manhunt

Found a user named ["h3ck3r_h3_bh41"](https://twitter.com/h3ck3r_h3_bh41) on twitter(X).

He tweeted about **Cookie the baby chick** and we found an instagram account with the name [@cookiethebabychick](https://www.instagram.com/cookiethebabychick/)

One of the followers of this account was [Simon_J_Peter](https://www.instagram.com/simon_j_peter/)

The account also had a link to the youtube channel [husky woof woof](https://www.youtube.com/@huskywoofwoof) which is owned by Simon_J_Peter

We found this an id on LinkedIn with the name [husky (Call me John) woof woof](https://www.linkedin.com/in/husky-woof-woof-3800342b8/) from which we assumed the name of the hacker is **Simon_John_Peter**.

We find this [image](stock.jpg) from one of the posts of the instagram account which had exif data of the [location](https://www.google.com/maps/place/19%C2%B057'41.5%22N+79%C2%B017'46.1%22E/@19.9622076,79.2897341).

The location and the image led us to conclude that the suspect is in the **Tadoba National Park** and on further clarification in the tickets we were able to find the site to be of [Tadoba National Park](https://www.tadobanationalpark.in/) granting us the final part of the flag.
