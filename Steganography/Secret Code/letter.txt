To,

I am Akshay, an ex employee at a Tech firm. Over all the years, I have been trading Cypto currencies and made a lot of money doing that. Now I want to withdraw my money, but I'll be charged a huge tax for the transaction in my country.

I got to know that you are a nice person and also your country doesn't charge any tax so I need your help. 

I want you to withdraw the money and hand over to me. But I feel some hackers are spying on my internet activity, so I am sharing this file with you. Get the password and withdraw it before the hackers have the access to my account.

Your friend,
Akshay
