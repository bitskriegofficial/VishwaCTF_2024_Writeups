# CODEON

The matrices P and Q were multiplied elementally and then each element was taken mod by 118.

We then do the same operations on A and B matrices and replaced the numbers with their elemental representation.

We find the word **amino acids** in this word search game.

Then we use a [bifid cipher](https://cryptii.com/pipes/bifid-cipher) decoder with the key **amino acids** to translate the codons

We then used [dcode DNA code](https://www.dcode.fr/codons-genetic-code) to get the flag.
